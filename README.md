My solutions for [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) site tasks.
# Advent of Code Solutions
Welcome to my repository where I tackle challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). As of now, I've completed all the puzzles from 2023 and solved 16 days from the 2022 edition. Each solution is written in an object-oriented style, ensuring clear and maintainable code, with strict type checking enforced via MyPy.

I'm continuously refining my solutions and working through any unfinished puzzles. My goal for the upcoming year is to participate more actively and aim for higher positions on the leaderboard by focusing on speed and efficiency in solving tasks.

## [Year 2023](2023/)
- Status: All puzzles completed
- Details: Full object-oriented solutions with MyPy type checking.
## [Year 2022](2022/)
- Status: 16 puzzles completed (work in progress)
- Details: Ongoing effort to complete the remaining puzzles while adhering to the same object-oriented and type-safe approach.

Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any suggestions or feedback, Iâ€™d love to hear it!
